# Vending machine example

## Installing
I use `rbenv` to manage my Ruby versions and am using 2.7.1. 
Should work in other versions though.

## Running

## Tests

Run `rake test` to run all tests/specs.

## Developing
Run `ruby ./bin/console.rb` to get an instance of `irb` running with all the classes loaded.

## Issues I had

- Setting up the project - it's been ages since I do this, and I normally work in a Rails context.
Setting up the tests in particular was a bit of a pain.
